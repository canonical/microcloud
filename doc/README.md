# MicroCloud documentation

We advise you to read the [published documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/microcloud/latest/microcloud/) rather than reading the documentation through GitHub. The GitHub web interface provides a basic rendering of the documentation. However, important features are missing, such as includes and cross-references.
