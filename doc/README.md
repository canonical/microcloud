# MicroCloud documentation

We advise you to read the [published documentation](https://canonical-microcloud.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest) rather than reading the documentation through GitHub. The GitHub web interface provides a basic rendering of the documentation. However, important features are missing, such as includes and cross-references.
