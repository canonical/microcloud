MicroCloud
==========

MicroCloud is the easiest way to get a fully highly available LXD cluster up and running.

sdfdsfsd master The MicroCloud snap automatically configures `LXD`_, `Ceph`_, and `OVN`_ across a set of servers.
MicroCloud relies on mDNS to automatically detect other servers on the network, making it possible to set up a complete cluster by running a single command on one of the machines.

This way, MicroCloud creates a small footprint cluster of compute nodes with distributed storage and secure networking, optimised for repeatable, reliable remote deployments.

MicroCloud is aimed at edge computing, and anyone in need of a small-scale private cloud.
