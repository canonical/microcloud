# How to get support

We recommend using the following channels for the snaps required to run MicroCloud:

* For MicroCloud: `2/(stable|candidate|edge)`
* For LXD: `5.21/(stable|candidate|edge)`
* For MicroCeph: `squid/(stable|candidate|edge)`
* For MicroOVN: `24.03/(stable|candidate|edge)`

```{note}
The LTS version of MicroCloud is available in the `2` track.
It's recommended to use the `<track>/stable` channels for production deployments.
```

```{important}
MicroCloud `1/(stable|candidate|edge)` reaches {abbr}`EOL (End of Life)` at the end of April 2025.
Make sure to upgrade to the `2` LTS track before this date.
See the {ref}`howto-update-upgrade-upgrade` guide for more information.
```
