# How to get support

We recommend using the following channels for the snaps required to run MicroCloud:

* For MicroCloud: `2/(stable|candidate|edge)`
* For LXD: `5.21/(stable|candidate|edge)`
* For MicroCeph: `squid/(stable|candidate|edge)`
* For MicroOVN: `24.03/(stable|candidate|edge)`

The LTS version of MicroCloud is available in the `2` track.
It's recommended to use the `<track>/stable` channels for production deployments.

```{admonition} Users of the 1 track
:class: important
MicroCloud `1/(stable|candidate|edge)` reached {abbr}`EOL (End of Life)` at the end of April 2025.
If you use this track, make sure to upgrade to the `2` LTS track. See the {ref}`howto-update-upgrade-upgrade` guide for more information.
```
