# How to install MicroCloud

To install MicroCloud, install all required {ref}`snaps` on all machines that you want to include in your cluster.

To do so, enter the following commands on all machines:

    sudo snap install lxd --channel=5.21/stable --cohort="+"
    sudo snap install microceph --channel=quincy/stable --cohort="+"
    sudo snap install microovn --channel=22.03/stable --cohort="+"
    sudo snap install microcloud --channel=latest/stable --cohort="+"

```{note}
Make sure to install the same version of the snaps on all machines.
See {ref}`howto-snap` for more information.

If you don't want to use MicroCloud's full functionality, you can install only some of the snaps.
However, this is not recommended.
